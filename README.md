# Web-Based Arduino Mini Simulator

This project is a minimal web-based Arduino simulator developed as part of the
FOSSEE OSHW Semester Long Internship 2025 screening task.

## Features Implemented
- Arduino UNO, LED, Push Button components
- Automatic pin assignment
- Pin conflict prevention
- Automatic Arduino code generation
- Logic-level simulation (Button controls LED)

## Limitations
- No real AVR execution
- Logic-level simulation only
- UI kept minimal intentionally
